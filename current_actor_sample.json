Now some folks might have a hard time with fitment but they do have multiple size ear pieces.Music wise? This had clean clear vocals, the bass is not as heavy as beats are.  Worked great for my music library. Now I lost my set, but for the year i used it it held charge for the gym week. 1-1.5hr a day / 4 days a week before i needed to charge it.I also paid for a $50 protective waterproof case for it haha so im even more annoyed i cant find them.Anyways the new gens are probably better but this generation i liked a lot.",

      "reviewTitle": "Amazing sound and functionality!",
      "reviewDescription": "Wow, these really exceeded my expectations. I’m usually slow to buy new Apple products because mostly I feel my needs are more than met by the iPhone and MacBook Air I own. But I also find myself frequently fumbling with ugly tangled headphone cables, attaching and detaching (and sometimes losing) the obnoxious “dongle” needed to switch from my iPhone’s lightning jack to my MacBook’s headphone jack, and I find the sound quality on the standard Apple earbuds pretty bad for anything but the most utilitarian listening, e.g. a news podcast or a call to the bank. So I’m pleased to report that my AirPods have already become *incredibly* useful in the first week of use for their ability to connect almost instantly, and with fabulous intuition about when and where to connect, to either my two primary devices, transforming my day’s patchwork of Zoom sessions (I’m a therapist and a yoga teacher), phone calls, audiobooks, podcasts, and music into something much smoother and more flowing.The features, and their usefulness, were what surprised me. When I bought these I had assumed, wrongly, that they would basically be the same as the standard Apple earbuds, but made wireless. On the contrary, the sound here is massively better, a gigantic leap from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, and the sound can be shaped in several useful ways:1) Noise-Cancelling Mode, which instantly sucks the background noise out so well for a moment you’ll think you’ve gone deaf2) Transparency Mode, my favorite, which beautifully mixes the original sound source (music, podcast, etc) with the sound of your own breath and the outside world. The levels are perfectly adjusted to give you an amazingly crisp listening experiencing while remaining aware of your surroundings. It’s ideal. If in a dystopian Total Recall scenario a microchip were implanted in my head to play music, this would represent the best possible audio mix.3) Normal Mode/“Off”, which gives the unmixed, untreated effect of standard headphones, allowing the normal amount of bleed between the sound in the ears and the slightly muffled sound of the outside world. This is the only mode I have no use for, because the other two are such big improvements to me.Turning these features on and off, pausing, or switching between music tracks works very well with the old “pinch the stem” technique that most wireless earbuds use. It’s the Morse Code style, squeeze once for this, squeeze twice for that system, and while it occasionally fails to understand what I want to do, it is much more intuitive and accurate than the few other brands I’ve tried. I’d say it following 3/4 of my commands perfectly, which for me is good enough, and again a vast improvement on other wireless earbuds I’ve tried, which usually suffer horribly in this category. I was a bit worried about this feature due to past negative experiences, but there was nothing to fear. Once again, Apple made the best.My strongest area of constructive critique is the voice quality of a AirPod user as experienced by the listener. The sound is crystal clear, and the volume is well-controlled, but it does sound slightly sterile and thin to my ears. I am a therapist and a yoga teacher and I frequently see clients through Zoom or other streaming video, so I was hopeful that these might also double as a solution for a wireless microphone. But I find the sound of a voice over AirPods in Zoom to be too thin and papery to match the sound of a good or even mid-level wireless mic. They sound best-suited to business purposes to me. Your experience may differ! That said, these are about half the price of an average studio or wireless mic, so this is not a crime, merely a point worth noting for other users.They are also a bit distracting visually for me, as  their shape is a little chunky and protruding from the ears, and their milk-white color really pops against the skin. They are by no means huge or ridiculous, you’ll feel fine wearing them, but they are large enough that I am persistently aware of them when I see someone over video talking to me or giving some kind of instruction. It also throws me off slightly because I associate headphones with someone being unable to hear me, rather than as a way to connect with me. This is another reason that a wireless mic or a proper studio mic still has its place. That said, connecting a wireless or studio mic to literally any Apple device requires a bit of technical knowhow, plus a receiver and a collection of cables and connectors to get it to work, and with AirPods you just take them out of the case and that’s it, and you’re connected!Great product. These are the droids you’re looking for.",

      "reviewTitle": "AirPods Pro 1st Gen",
      "reviewDescription": "I’ve had my 1st gen AirPods Pro for over a year now, and they’ve held up surprisingly well. The noise cancellation is excellent — it doesn’t block everything, but it drastically reduces background noise, making commutes and office work much more bearable. Transparency mode is also super useful when you need to stay aware of your surroundings. Sound quality is crisp, with decent bass for earbuds this size. Not audiophile-level, but definitely better than regular AirPods. Calls are clear on both ends, and switching between Apple devices is seamless — the ecosystem integration really shines here. Comfort-wise, they fit snugly without being intrusive. I wear them for hours without discomfort, and they stay in during workouts. Battery life is decent: around 4–5 hours per charge, and the case holds multiple recharges. Over time, the battery has started to dip slightly, but that’s expected with daily use. Only downside? The price still feels steep for a first-gen model with newer versions out now. But if you find them on sale, they’re absolutely worth it. Let me know if you want a review from a different perspective (e.g. techie, casual listener, traveler, etc.)!",

      "reviewDescription": "i had these airpods for 4-5 years before they went out. i was very impressed with the sound quality & how easy it was to switch between transparency & noise cancellation. they did slip out of my ears sometimes, but there are ear pieces you can buy to prevent this & also comes with some as well. i wish they still made these because i would buy them again. i also dropped them plenty of times & they didn’t break. loved this product. they are easy to work as well.",

Perfectos para aquellos que estamos en constante movimiento todo el día, eso si, las gomitas sellan muy bien el canal auditivo por lo que tienes que tener cuidado con el tamaño que seleccionas para las mismas, al igual que siempre será recomendable que primero conozcan qué tan bien se adaptan ustedes a los audífonos de gomitas ya que es por ello por lo que mucha gente no logra acomodarse a estos audífonos.PD: También depende mucho del ecosistema en el que te desenvuelvas, su funcionalidad con dispositivos apple es perfecta pero si cuentas con un android o la mayor parte de tu ecosistema es android puede que existan mejores opciones.",

Lo único que me decepciono fue que el material de los audífonos y la mano factura de ellos, se ve de una calidad regular, así como la caja la cual se le escucha moverse un poco la tapa, dando la sensación de ser una bisagra de material barato.
